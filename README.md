# Wrangle-and-Analyze-WeRateDogs-Twitter-Archive

Introduction
------------
[WeRateDogs] (https://twitter.com/dog_rates) is a Twitter account that is well-known for its pictures and commentary of dogs. Its popularity is built upon the internet's obsession with dogs, and its unique rating system that reflects how good all dogs are.

The data for this project was gathered from three different sources. The first dataset was loaded from the downloaded file 'twitter-archive-enhanced.csv'. The second dataset was programmatically requested from [here] (https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv). The third dataset was gathered from the .json data accessed from the Twitter API through Tweepy.

The goal of this project is to wrangle (gather, assess, clean) and then apply analysis with visualization for three insights:

* How do people engage with WeRateDogs' content (retweets and favorites) over time?
* How are dogs usually rated?
* Which are the most favorited dog breeds and how are they rated?

The original datasets are available here for your quick download. You can also get access to my notebook wrangle_act.ipynb to review the actual code. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions in the introduction. Markdown cells will assist in walking through the thought process for each step.
